# From_2D_to_3D
This capstone project develops a semi-automated AI pipeline that transforms traditional 2D civil floor plans into interactive 3D building models. By combining deep learning, geometric processing, and 3D visualization, the system streamlines how architects, engineers, and construction teams interpret plan drawings.
